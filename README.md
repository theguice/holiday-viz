IO Lab Project 4 - INFO 290TA

Project title - "Our Paths"

Project description - 
The project visualizes the GPS data captured by the user. The user can upload his/her GPS data and visualize the journey.
Also, the user can see the pictures taken during the journey. We have implemented functionality to draw, animate the paths and mashed up with images. We also show some graphs on how the distance was covered, time was spent during the journey etc. We have data of about 6-7 users and their pictures. This data was collected during the Thanksgiving weekend and is  stored in the database. We will show how the user spent their Thanksgiving using this app in the demo!
